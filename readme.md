## NC Birding Trail Website Redesign - Back End

This plugin supports the back end database redesign of the North Carolina Birding Trail website (www.ncbirdingtrail.org), developed as a WordPress theme (currently hosted at http://test.ncbirdingtrail.org). Primarily this will be the new website for the North Carolina, but with potential to be shareable to other trails using the WordPress platform.
